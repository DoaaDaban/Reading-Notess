# CSS (Cascading style sheets)

**CSS** is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts.

**CSS** used for very basic document text styling like changing the color and size of headings and links. and it's used to create layout like turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.


**CSS Syntax simple example: **

h1 {

    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}


**CSS Modules**

A CSS Module is a CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default. All URLs (url(...)) and @imports are in module request format (./xxx and ../xxx means relative, xxx and xxx/yyy means in modules folder, i. e. in node_modules).

CSS Modules compile to a low-level interchange format called ICSS or Interoperable CSS, but are written like normal CSS files.
