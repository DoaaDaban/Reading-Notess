## HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

 ** HTML **is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.

** HTML ** is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. 

** HTML elements: **
- Heading.
- Lists.
- Links.
- paragraphs.

It enables new opportunities for learning, building a sense of shared humanity, and solving the pressing problems facing people everywhere.


** Semantics ** In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".


** Semantics in HTML** for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page.


** Semantics in CSS ** consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?


** Semantics in JavaScript ** consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?
