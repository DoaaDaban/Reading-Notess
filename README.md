##Growth Mindset

The concept of a **Growth mindset** is to develop your mind and your skills through dedication and hard work so it can open pathways to more creativity and possibility, and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement.

There are two types of mindset

**1-Growth Mindset**

**2-Fixed Mindset**

The differences between **Growth mindset** and **Fixed mindset** are the challenges they meet and how each of them reacts with, you can simply see the growth mindsets embrace the challenges, while fixed mindsets avoid them. 
As well as, how each of them deals with obstacles and how growth mindsets persist, while, fixed mindsets lose focus and give up.
In addition to, when we talk about efforts the growth mindsets never give up and always use the role of no pain-no gain, while fixed mindset views as fruitless. Although growth mindsets always learn from criticisms, on the other hand, fixed mindsets ignore them.
Also when we talk about how each one of them looks at the success of others, the growth mindsets are inspired by them and then achieve more and higher goals, but fixed mindsets view as a threat and definitely fail to reach full potential. 

Finally, I always remind my self with these ***quotes*** to keep my self in a growth mindset:

-Great works are performed, not by strength, but by perseverance.

-The very best thing you can do for the whole world is to make the most of yourself.

-Don't worry about failure. ...

-It takes courage to grow up and become who you really are.
