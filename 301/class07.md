## Who is Roy Fielding?
He helped write the first web servers by helped write, HTTP,
Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

## Why don't the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

HTTP is first part tells the browser what protocol to use, it is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing, Because it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns, GET PUT POST PATCH

## What does a GET do?

It is. Especially when you're using a web browser because browsers pretty much just GET stuff. They don't do a lot of other types of interaction with resources. This is a problem because it has led many people to assume that HTTP is just for getting. But HTTP is actually a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns.

## What does a POST do?

If a system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST. 

## What does PUT do?

If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT,

## What does PATCH do?

to do a partial update, it will  hopefully use PATCH.
