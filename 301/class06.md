**What is node.js?**

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library. It is used for developing applications that make heavy use of the ability to run JavaScript both on the client, as well as on server side and therefore benefit from the re-usability of code and the lack of context switching.

**In your own words, what is Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine?**

The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

**What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**

A specific version of the V8 engine), this means that you can write your JavaScript using the latest and most modern syntax. It also means that you don't generally have to worry about compatibility issues — as you would if you were writing JavaScript that would run in different browsers.

**What is npm?**

In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world's largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week. Let's take a quick look at how we would use npm to install a package.

**What version of node are you running on your machine?**

Version: 6


**What command would you type to install a library/package called 'jshint'?**

npm install -g jshint

**What is node used for?**

Node.js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

**What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

- Greater efficiency
- Engaged collaboration
- Learning from fellow students
- Social skills
- Job interview readiness
- Work environment readiness

**In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

I would say Learning from fellow students really did benefuted me.

**How does pair programming work?**

While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the "mechanics" of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
