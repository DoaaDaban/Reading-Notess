# Expressions and operators

** Operators **

JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

- ** Assignment operators ** an assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.

- ** Comparison operators **  comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values.

- **Arithmetic operators ** an arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. The standard arithmetic operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). These operators work as they do in most other programming languages when used with floating point numbers (in particular, note that division by zero produces Infinity).

- ** Bitwise operators **
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Conditional (ternary) operator
- Comma operator
- Unary operators
- Relational operators

# MDN control flow

** Control flow ** is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Control flow also means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 

** Categories of control flow:**
- Continuation at a different statement (unconditional branch or jump)
- Executing a set of statements only if some condition is met (choice -       i.e., conditional branch)
- Executing a set of statements zero or more times, until some condition is   met (i.e., loop - the same as conditional branch)
- Executing a set of distant statements, after which the flow of control      usually returns (subroutines, coroutines, and continuations)
  Stopping the program, preventing any further execution (unconditional halt)

** Categories of control flow:**
- Labels
- Goto
- Subroutines
- Sequence

** Statements (Control flow): **
- Conditional statements
- Switch statements 
- Break statements 
- Exeption handling statements 
- Try...Catch statements 
- Nesting Try...Catch statements
